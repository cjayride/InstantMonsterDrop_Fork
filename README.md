## This mod causes monsters to drop their loot and poof immediately.

A very simple mod, it just removes the delay on monsters going poof and dropping their loot. Works on animals, monsters, etc.

Optionally, you can set separate custom delays for both loot drop and ragdoll destruction by editing the config file.

## **Configuration**

Run the game once to generate this config file: **BepInEx/config/cjayride.InstantMonsterDrop.cfg**
